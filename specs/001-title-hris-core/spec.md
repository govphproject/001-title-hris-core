# Feature Specification: HRIS Core ‚Äî Human Resource Information System

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-hris-core`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a Human Resource Information System (HRIS) that helps organizations manage employee information, streamline HR processes, and improve decision-making. The system should allow HR teams to store and update employee records (personal details, job history, performance reviews, training, benefits, etc.). It should also support payroll tracking, leave and attendance management, recruitment workflows, and performance evaluations. The goal is to reduce manual paperwork, ensure compliance, and give managers better visibility into workforce data. Employees should also have self-service access to view their information, request leave, and update basic details, which increases efficiency and transparency. This system should be scalable to handle growing organizations and customizable to meet different HR policy needs."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
- HR teams, hiring managers, payroll/finance staff, and employees use a single HRIS to manage employee lifecycle activities, reduce manual paperwork, and improve visibility into workforce data.
- HR admins maintain canonical employee records (personal details, job history, compensation, benefits, training, and performance records) and run reports for compliance.
- Managers approve leave and time, perform reviews, and view team analytics to make staffing decisions.
- Employees use a self-service portal to view payslips, request leave, update allowed personal details, and enroll in training.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an HR admin with appropriate permissions, **When** they create a new employee record with required fields (name, employee ID, hire date, employment status), **Then** the employee appears in the directory and is linkable to payroll and benefits workflows.
2. **Given** an employee submits a leave request, **When** the manager approves it, **Then** the request status becomes "Approved", the employee's leave balance is adjusted, and an audit entry is stored.
3. **Given** payroll for a pay period is finalized, **When** finance reviews the data, **Then** payroll records present gross pay, deductions, taxes, net pay, and an export option (CSV/Excel) for payroll processing.
4. **Given** a candidate is moved to "Hired" in the recruitment pipeline, **When** onboarding is initiated, **Then** a pre-filled employee record can be created from candidate data to avoid re-entry.
5. **Given** an employee updates an allowed personal detail (e.g., emergency contact), **When** the update is saved, **Then** HR can view the change and an audit log records who changed what and when.

### Edge Cases
- Concurrent updates: What should happen when two HR users update the same employee record at the same time? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: desired conflict resolution strategy (last-write-wins, optimistic locking with merge UI, or other)]
- Retroactive payroll changes: How are retro pays applied for closed pay periods and how should downstream reporting reflect adjustments? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: business rule for retro pay adjustments]
- Multi-country operations: How should multi-country payroll, currencies, tax rules, and benefits eligibility be modeled? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target countries/currencies/tax regimes and localization requirements]
- Data retention and termination: What is the retention, archiving, and deletion policy for terminated employees and former candidates? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period, export/archival requirements]
- Integration failures: When external integrations (timekeeping, benefits providers, tax engines) are unavailable, what is the desired fallback or retry behavior? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: offline/fallback policy]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow HR users to create, read, update, and archive employee records containing personal details, job history, compensation records, benefits enrollment, training history, and performance reviews.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide role-based access control so HR, Managers, Payroll, Recruiters, and Employees see and edit only data they are permitted to access. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: definitive role list and permission matrix]
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an employee directory with search, filter, and export capabilities (by name, employee ID, department, location, role, employment status).
- **FR-004**: System MUST enable employee self-service for viewing profile, requesting leave, viewing payslips, and updating allowed personal details; all changes must be auditable with actor and timestamp.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
